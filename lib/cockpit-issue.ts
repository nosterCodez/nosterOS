/**
 * The shape of the "nosterOS Cockpit" issue on the Paperclip board.
 *
 * The cockpit is a standing chat thread between the operator and the Conductor,
 * not a task with a disposition. Paperclip has two automations that treat it
 * as a task: the successful-run handoff (a run that ends without moving the
 * issue is treated as missing a disposition) and the stranded-issue recovery
 * sweep. Both only fire on issues that are `in_progress` / `todo` / `in_review`
 * with an agent assignee, and the handoff attempt budget is effectively zero,
 * so with the wrong status they can ping-pong the Conductor through repeated
 * runs and burn its usage window.
 *
 * `backlog` is the one status both automations skip while a new comment on
 * the issue still wakes the agent assignee. A human co-owner would also
 * shield it, but the board allows exactly one assignee, and the Conductor has
 * to be that one or comments stop waking it. This module owns the shape; the
 * connector applies it on create and on repair.
