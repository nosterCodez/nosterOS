/**
 * Model failover for the Paperclip board.
 *
 * The triggering failure: the Conductor (CEO seat) sat in `error` because Fable 5 ran out
 * of usage credits, and it stayed there. Paperclip has a quota classifier but
 * it does not help here for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. Its regex (CLAUDE_PROVIDER_QUOTA_RE, claude-local adapter) knows
 * "usage limit reached" and "extra usage" but not the credit-exhaustion
 * wording the CLI and the ACP lane actually emit, so the run was filed as
 * a generic hard failure. Nothing retried it.
 * 2. Even on a recognised quota error Paperclip WAITS for the window to
 * reset. It never changes model.
 *
 * The operator's requirement is that the company keeps running: when Fable is out,
 * drop to Opus 5. That policy lives here, outside Paperclip, so it survives
 * upstream upgrades and works for both the CLI and ACP lanes.
 *
 * Everything in this file is pure. The board calls live in
 * lib/connectors/paperclip.ts and the loop that applies a plan is
 * app/api/agents/failover/route.ts.
 */

/**
 * Where each model falls when it runs dry, in order of preference.
 *
 * Opus 5 is the first stop for everything above it because it is the strongest
 * seat that is not on the operator's Fable budget.
 *
 * The ladder must be ACYCLIC, not merely free of self-references. It used to
 * carry sonnet-5 -> haiku-4-5 and haiku-4-5 -> sonnet-5, and that two-cycle
 * flapped five live seats back and forth every five minutes for
 * an hour and a half: each tick condemned whichever of the two models had just
 * errored and moved every seat onto the other one, which then errored. So
 * haiku-4-5 is the floor and falls nowhere. A seat that runs dry there earns a
 * note for a human, never a promotion. tests/failover-no-flap.test.ts pins it.
