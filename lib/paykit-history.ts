/**
 * PayKit snapshot history — a SEPARATE better-sqlite3 store (data/paykit.db),
 * deliberately NOT wired into lib/db.ts's repo layer, same as the ledger and bank
 * stores. It holds one row per customer per day: the running lifetime totals the
 * /customers endpoint reports.
 *
 * Why it exists: PayKit has exactly two public endpoints and neither is a
 * transaction feed, so a month can only be recovered by DIFFERENCING two reads of
 * the lifetime totals. The finances page already pulls /customers on every render
 * and threw the result away; this keeps it. See connectors/payments.ts for the
 * arithmetic.
 *
 * No PII: ids and numbers only. Names, emails and phone numbers come back in the
 * same payload and are dropped on the way in — nothing downstream needs them, and
 * a file of payer contact details is a liability this feature does not require.
 */

/**
 * The oldest snapshot in the store: a RECONSTRUCTION rather than a capture, kept
 * so the first full month after it resolves to an exact figure instead of a band.
 *
 * The shape is the point, not the contents — these are invented demo customers
 * (ids 9000xx, round amounts, UTC timestamps). A real deployment overwrites this
 * day the moment an actual capture for it is recorded.
 *
 * How a reconstruction like this is derived, for reference: lifetime totals only
 * rise, so an aggregate delta of +1 transaction / +$X between two reads is one
 * customer gaining one transaction of $X and cannot be spread across several. The
 * customer whose last-transaction date sits after the earlier read's high-water
 * mark is necessarily that customer; everyone else's row carries back unchanged.
 * The derived customer's PRIOR transaction date is genuinely unknown, so it is
 * null rather than invented — nothing reads a previous snapshot's date.
 *
 * Marked `source: 'reconstructed'` so it can never be read as a measurement.
