/**
 * Live business-pulse metrics for /api/metrics.
 *
 * These four numbers used to come straight out of `lib/seed.ts` as literal
 * zeros, captioned "pending creds" — captions that were themselves false, since
 * every one of the four creds works. No component reads this endpoint, so
 * nothing looked broken; the real consumer is the agent harness, whose standing
 * instructions say "quote real numbers from these APIs instead of guessing".
 * An agent obeying that reported Stripe $0 / unread 0 / brain 0 to the operator as
 * fact. This module exists to make that impossible.
 *
 * The contract, and the whole point of the file:
 *
 *   value === null  ⇒  we could not read it. `period` says why.
 *   value === 0     ⇒  we read it, and it really is zero.
 *
 * A failed read must never look like a measurement. That is why nothing here
 * falls back to a default, and why every source is guarded independently — one
 * dead connector degrades one tile rather than the endpoint.
 *
 * Shares the honest-pending vocabulary of `lib/operating-metrics.ts` (the
 * Analytics strip's `MetricInput`), so a tile can move between the two without
 * translation. It does NOT borrow that module's positive-values-only rule for
 * liveness: on the Analytics strip a zero is indistinguishable from an empty
 * tile and is fine to hide, but here a genuine "0 unread" is a real answer to a
 * question an agent asked, and collapsing it into "pending" would be the same
 * class of lie in the other direction.
