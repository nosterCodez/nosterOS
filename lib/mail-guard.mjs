/**
 * Outbound mail guard. Shared by every SMTP path in this repo.
 *
 * Why this exists: agent-generated mail can go out to real third parties
 * without anyone approving a recipient. An invented address only stays safe
 * as long as it happens not to resolve; a live domain with real mail
 * exchange would hand a stranger whatever the message contained. Any
 * unattended send path is exposed to this, so the check lives here, once,
 * and every caller runs through it rather than each path guessing on its own.
 *
 * Default posture: mail to the operator's own inboxes is fine (internal alerting keeps
 * working); mail to anyone else is refused. Callers surface the refusal honestly
 * rather than throwing: the cockpit already falls back to a `mailto:` draft on a
 * non-ok result, so a blocked send degrades into the operator sending it themselves
 * from their own mail client, which is the correct human-in-the-loop outcome.
 *
 * Overrides are deliberately env-only and per-invocation, never defaults:
 * MAIL_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=1 allow external recipients
 * MAIL_ALLOW_FOUNDEROS_FROM=1 allow sending as founder@founderos.example.com
