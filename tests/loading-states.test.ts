/**
 * Every route this app serves is `force-dynamic` (live connector/DB reads at
 * request time) and none of them had a `loading.tsx`. In the App Router that
 * combination means a sidebar click produces NO visual response at all until
 * the entire server render finishes -- the click looks dead even on a page
 * that only takes 500ms, because nothing paints in between. `loading.tsx`
 * fixes both halves at once: it is what Next shows INSTANTLY on navigation
 * (a real click response), and it is also the boundary Next needs in order
 * to prefetch anything for a dynamic route (the "preload while I'm using it"
 * ask) -- a fully dynamic page with no loading boundary has nothing to
 * prefetch up to.
 *
 * This is a coverage net in the same shape as the page/route smoke nets: it
 * walks app/ itself for the ground truth, so a new route cannot silently
 * ship without a loading state the way three routes just did.
