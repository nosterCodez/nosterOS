/**
 * Removing something from the seed has to reach a database that already exists,
 * or it only ever works on a fresh clone.
 *
 * Found the hard way on 2026-08-19. Notion and WebinarJam were deleted from
 * lib/seed.ts, tests passed, the deploy landed — and the host went on serving
 * the notion-sync agent and the tool-webinarjam row, because:
 *
 *  1. getDb() only calls seedDemoFixture() when one of a list of tables is EMPTY.
 *     On the host every table is full, so the seed had not run in months.
 *  2. `tools` had no deleteWhereIdNotIn, so even a re-seed would have left the
 *     retired tool rows behind. INSERT OR REPLACE adds and updates; it never
 *     removes a row that has LEFT the seed.
 *
 * A version stamp fixes the first (bump SEED_VERSION and every database
 * re-seeds once), and the prune fixes the second.
